# difference between std::move and std::forward?
std::move takes an object and allows you to treat it as an rvalue

std::forward: to cast a templated function parameter (inside the function) to the value category (lvalue or rvalue) 
the caller used to pass it. 
This allows rvalue arguments to be passed on as rvalues, and lvalues to be passed on as lvalues, called “perfect forwarding.”
